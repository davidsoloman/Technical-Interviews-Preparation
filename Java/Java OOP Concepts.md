# Java OOP Concepts

- **Object**: An entity that has state and behavior. It can be physical and logical.
- **Class**: Collection of objects. It is a logical entity.
- **Inheritance**: When one object acquires all the properties and behaviours of parent object. It provides code reusability. It is used to achieve runtime polymorphism.
- **Polymorphism**: When one task is performed by different ways. In Java, we use method overloading and method overriding to achieve polymorphism.
- **Abstraction**: Hiding internal details and showing functionality. In Java, we use abstract class and interface to achieve abstraction.
- **Encapsulation**: Binding (or wrapping) code and data together into a single unit. A Java class is the example of encapsulation.
- **Reflection**: Code which is able to inspect other code in the same system (or itself).
